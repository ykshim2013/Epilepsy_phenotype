## 5. Phenotype Review

### 5.1 Onset Age (onset)

| Phenotype | Seizure Onset | Typical Outcome |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **BFNS/SLFNE** (Benign/Self-Limited Familial Neonatal Epilepsy) | Day 2-8 of life | Self-limited, resolves 1-12 months |
| **KCNQ2-DEE** (Neonatal-Onset DEE) | First 2 weeks of life | Severe, developmental impairment |

**Seizure Characteristics:**
- Generalized hypertonia with apnea and cyanosis
- Followed by head movement and/or clonic/tonic-clonic limb jerks
- BFNS: Seizure-free by 6 months in most patients
- DEE: Ongoing seizures with developmental arrest

### 5.2 Responsive Anti-Seizure Medications (responsive ASM)

#### First-Line Treatments

| ASM | Efficacy | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Carbamazepine** | **High (First-Line)** | Most effective, ~40% seizure control in 2 weeks |
| **Phenytoin** | **High (First-Line)** | 33% seizure-free |
| **Oxcarbazepine** | High | Alternative sodium channel blocker |
| **Lacosamide** | Moderate-High | Newer option with good tolerability |
| **Phenobarbital** | Moderate | Commonly used in neonates |

**Treatment Efficacy Data:**
- **~80% of KCNQ2/SCN2A-related epilepsies** have full response to sodium channel blockers
- 95% of BFNS patients became seizure-free with treatment
- 73% of DEE patients achieved seizure control (95% required polytherapy)

**Critical Treatment Insight:**
> "Sodium channel blockers like phenytoin and carbamazepine have been particularly effective in KCNQ2 encephalopathy and BFNS. Thus, they are suggested for first-line treatment." - [Seizure Journal, 2017](https://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(17)30205-4/fulltext)

**Importance of Early Treatment:**
> "The two patients whose seizures ceased within a few days of onset showed only mild cognitive impairment." - Early treatment may improve developmental outcomes

### 5.3 Syndrome Diagnosis / Gene-Specific Classification

| Classification | OMIM | Key Features |
|----------------|------|--------------|
| **BFNS1 / SLFNE** (Self-Limited Familial Neonatal Epilepsy) | 121200 | Benign, self-limited, favorable outcome |
| **KCNQ2-DEE** (Neonatal-Onset Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy) | 613720 | Severe, refractory, developmental impairment |
| **Myokymia** | - | Rare phenotype with KCNQ2 variants |

**Phenotype Spectrum:**
- KCNQ2-related disorders represent a **continuum** from SLFNE (mild) to NEO-DEE (severe)
- Missense mutations: 96% of DEE patients
- Truncating mutations: More common in BFNS

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlation:**
- Location of mutation within the channel affects severity
- Variants in pore region → more severe phenotypes
- The type of KCNQ2 mutation influences both AED response and developmental outcome

*Note: KCNQ2 is the most common single-gene cause of neonatal-onset epilepsy with an estimated incidence of 1 per 17,000 live births. Variant counts are based on ClinVar database accessed January 2026. Early recognition and treatment with sodium channel blockers is critical for optimal outcomes.*
