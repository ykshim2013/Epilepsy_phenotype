- **Institutions:**
  - Division of Pediatric Neurology, Severance Children's Hospital, Yonsei University, Seoul
  - Department of Pediatrics, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon
  - Department of Laboratory Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University, Seoul

- **Institution:** Epilepsy Research Institute, Severance Children's Hospital, Yonsei University
- **Study Type:** Large-scale genetic epidemiology (957 Asian patients, 99% Korean)

### 4.3 Reported Patients (전체보고 환자수)

| Study | Institution | Patients | Source Cohort | Key Findings |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Kim HJ et al. 2020 | Severance & Gachon | **11** | 730 DEE patients | Treatment response detailed |
| Kim SH et al. 2024 | Severance | **14** | 957 epilepsy patients | 3rd most common gene |

**Clinical Characteristics of Korean Cohort (Kim HJ et al. 2020, n=11):**

| Feature | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Age at study | 0.4 - 9.7 years |
| Neonatal onset | 6 patients (55%) |
| Infantile onset | 4 patients (36%) |
| Childhood onset | 1 patient (9%) |
| Mutation type (neonatal/infantile) | All missense |
| Mutation type (childhood) | Truncation |

**Epilepsy Syndromes Identified:**
- Ohtahara syndrome
- West syndrome
- Epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS)
- Focal epilepsy

### 4.4 Treatment Response in Korean Patients

| Treatment | Efficacy | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Sodium channel blockers** | 9/9 (100%) effective | Neonatal/infantile onset |
| **Ketogenic diet** | 6/8 (75%) effective | Good adjunctive response |
| **High-dose steroids** | 4/5 (80%) effective | For spasms |
| **Drug-resistant epilepsy** | 9/10 (90%) | Before targeted treatment |

**Critical Finding:**
> "Sodium channel blockers were effective in all treated patients (9/9) with neonatal-to-infantile onset, but worsened seizures in the childhood-onset patient with a truncation mutation."

This confirms the genotype-phenotype-treatment correlation:
- **Missense (GOF)** → Early onset → Sodium channel blockers effective
- **Truncation (LOF)** → Later onset → Sodium channel blockers contraindicated

### 4.5 Variant-to-Patient Frequency (variant별 환자수 빈도)
- 25 patients with SCN2A mutations in Korean literature
- Predominantly de novo variants (1:1)
- Frequency in Korean DEE cohort: 1.5% (11/730) - similar to international data (1.2%)

### 4.6 Korean Diagnostic Yield for SCN2A-Related Epilepsy

**From Kim SH et al. 2024 (n=957):**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total Korean epilepsy patients tested | 947 (99% of cohort) |
| Overall diagnostic yield | 32.4% (310/957) |
| SCN2A rank | 3rd most common gene |
| SCN2A cases | 14 patients |

**Gene Ranking in Korean Pediatric Epilepsy:**
1. SCN1A - 49 patients
2. STXBP1 - 15 patients
3. **SCN2A - 14 patients**
4. KCNQ2 - 13 patients
5. CDKL5 - 11 patients

## 5. Phenotype Review

### 5.1 Onset Age (onset)

| Phenotype | Seizure Onset | Functional Effect |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **BFNIS** (Benign Familial Neonatal-Infantile Seizures) | Day 1 - 12 months | Gain-of-Function |
| **DEE** (Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy, Type 11) | < 3 months | Gain-of-Function |
| **Late-onset DEE** | > 3 months - 1 year | Loss-of-Function |
| **ASD/ID without early epilepsy** | > 1 year (if seizures occur) | Loss-of-Function |

**Key Finding:** Age of seizure onset strongly correlates with variant function and treatment response.

### 5.2 Responsive Anti-Seizure Medications (responsive ASM)

#### Gain-of-Function Variants (Early Onset < 3 months)

| ASM | Efficacy | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Phenytoin** | High | First-line for neonatal onset |
| **Carbamazepine** | High | Sodium channel blocker |
| **Oxcarbazepine** | High | 28.9% seizure-free rate |
| **Lacosamide** | Moderate-High | Good tolerability |
| **Lamotrigine** | Moderate | Sodium channel mechanism |
| **Zonisamide** | Moderate | Alternative option |

#### Loss-of-Function Variants (Late Onset > 1 year)

| ASM | Efficacy | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Sodium channel blockers** | **AVOID** | May worsen seizures |
| **Valproate** | Variable | Consider as alternative |
| **Levetiracetam** | Variable | Broad-spectrum option |
| **Ketogenic diet** | Reported benefit | For refractory cases |

**Critical Treatment Insight:**
> "Sodium channel blockers often worsen seizures in patients with seizure onset beyond 1 year of age." - [Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.809951/full)

### 5.3 Syndrome Diagnosis / Gene-Specific Classification

| Classification | OMIM | Key Features |
|----------------|------|--------------|
| **DEE11** (Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy, Type 11) | 613721 | Severe, early-onset, refractory epilepsy |
| **BFNIS** (Benign Familial Neonatal-Infantile Seizures, Type 3) | 607745 | Self-limited, favorable outcome |
| **Episodic Ataxia Type 9** | 618924 | Movement disorder phenotype |
| **ASD/ID** | - | Autism spectrum disorder with/without seizures |

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlation:**
- **Gain-of-function** → BFNIS, Early DEE (< 3 months), responds to Na+ channel blockers
- **Loss-of-function** → Late DEE, ASD/ID, Na+ channel blockers contraindicated
