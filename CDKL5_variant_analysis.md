**Drug-Resistant Nature:**
> "Over one-quarter of the patients had tried eight or more antiepileptic medications, demonstrating the highly treatment-resistant nature of CDKL5-related epilepsy."

**Long-Term Efficacy Challenge:**

| Time Point | Responder Rate (>50% reduction) |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| 3 months | 69% (27/39) |
| 6 months | 45% (17/38) |
| 12 months | **Only 24%** (9/38) |

| Usage rate | 51% of patients tried KD |
| Initial benefit | 88% showed improvement |
| Long-term retention | Only 32% remained on diet |

### 5.3 Syndrome Diagnosis / Gene-Specific Classification

| Classification | OMIM | Key Features |
|----------------|------|--------------|

| **CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD)** | - | Current preferred terminology |
| **Atypical Rett Syndrome** | - | Historical classification (no longer preferred) |

**Distinction from Rett Syndrome:**
> "Initially described as an early onset seizure variant of Rett syndrome, the CDKL5 disorder is now considered as an independent entity." - [PMC, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27080038/)

**CDKL5 vs. Classical Rett Syndrome:**

| Feature | CDKL5 | Rett Syndrome |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Epilepsy | More common | Less common |
| GI problems | More common | Less common |
| Sleep abnormalities | More common | Less common |
| Scoliosis | Less prevalent | More prevalent |
| Respiratory problems | Less prevalent | More prevalent |

**Clinical Features:**
- Severe early-onset intractable epilepsy
- Motor, cognitive, visual, and autonomic disturbances
- Movement disorders (chorea, dystonia)
- Hand and leg stereotypies
- Cortical visual impairment
- Gastrointestinal symptoms
- Sleep disturbances

**X-Linked Inheritance Pattern:**
- Females more commonly affected (4:1 ratio)
- Hemizygous males can be equally severe
- Severity varies based on:
  - Type and position of pathogenic variant
  - Pattern of X-chromosome inactivation (females)
  - Presence of postzygotic mosaicism

*Note: CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder is characterized by early-onset, severe, drug-resistant epilepsy with a median seizure onset of 6 weeks. Vigabatrin shows the best efficacy among ASMs, though long-term seizure control remains challenging. Variant counts are based on ClinVar database accessed January 2026. The disorder is now recognized as distinct from Rett syndrome.*
