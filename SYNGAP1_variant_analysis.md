## 5. Phenotype Review

### 5.1 Onset Age (onset)

| Feature | Onset Age | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Developmental Delay** | Birth - 6 months | Precedes seizures in 96% |
| **Epilepsy Onset** | Median 2 years (range: 4 months - 7 years) | After developmental delay |
| **Microdeletion cases** | 20 months | Earlier seizure onset |

**Key Finding:**
> "Developmental delay preceded seizure onset in 54 of 56 (96%) patients." - [Neurology, 2019](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000006729)

**Developmental Milestones:**
- Average age at walking: **26 months** (range: 10.5 months to 5 years)
- Speech: Typically delayed or absent
- Intellectual disability: Moderate to severe in majority

### 5.2 Responsive Anti-Seizure Medications (responsive ASM)

| ASM | Efficacy | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Valproate** | Most commonly used | 64% ongoing prescription |
| **Lamotrigine** | High retention rate | 77% ongoing prescription |
| **Topiramate** | Reported benefit | Commonly used |
| **Levetiracetam** | Variable | Used in combination |
| **Cannabidiol** | Promising | 83% (5/6) remained on treatment |
| **Clobazam** | Variable | Adjunctive therapy |

**Drug-Resistant Epilepsy:**
- **63% of patients** have refractory epilepsy after 2 AEDs
- **71% of adults** have drug-resistant seizures
- Polytherapy often required

**Effective Combinations (from literature):**
- Levetiracetam + Topiramate
- Valproate + Lamotrigine
- Cannabidiol + Valproate + Lamotrigine

**Non-Pharmacological Options:**
- **Ketogenic diet**: Accepted approach for seizure reduction
- **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)**: For AED-resistant cases
- **Corpus Callosotomy**: Carefully selected patients

**Key Treatment Insight:**
> "Valproic acid and lamotrigine are the most commonly used drugs. It has been reported that epilepsy induced by SYNGAP1 gene mutations responded better to topiramate and cannabidiol." - [Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.761473/full)

| Seizure Type | Percentage |
|--------------|------------|

**Clinical Features:**
- Intellectual disability (100%)
- Generalized epilepsy (~84%)
- Autism spectrum disorder (≤50%)

**Critical Developmental Window:**
> "The critical developmental plateau occurs between the ages of 2 and 5 years and is potentially influenced by epilepsy." - [Epilepsia, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38563110/)
