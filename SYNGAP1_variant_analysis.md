### 4.3 Reported Patients (전체보고 환자수)

| Study | Institution | Patients | Age Range | Key Findings |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Kim et al. 2024 | Seoul National University Children's Hospital | **13** | Pediatric (longitudinal follow-up) | First Korean cohort study |

**Clinical Characteristics of Korean Cohort (n=13):**

| Feature | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Global developmental delay | 100% (from early infancy) |
| Epilepsy | 77% (10/13 patients) |
| Median seizure onset | 31 months |
| Motor development | Independent ambulation by 3 years |
| Language outcomes | Nonverbal to 2-3 word sentences |
| Developmental plateau | Ages 2-5 years |

**Key Clinical Insights from Korean Cohort:**
- Developmental delay consistently preceded seizure onset
- Language development plateaued in all patients
- Best language outcomes: 2-3 word sentences (developmental age 2-3 years)
- Epilepsy onset followed developmental delays (not concurrent)
- Critical developmental window: ages 2-5 years

### 4.4 Variant-to-Patient Frequency (variant별 환자수 빈도)
- 13 patients with SYNGAP1 mutations (specific variants require full-text access)
- De novo mutations expected based on international data (~89%)

### 4.5 Unique Korean Study Contributions

**Longitudinal EEG Findings (Novel Biomarker):**
> "Longitudinal EEG data revealed a shift from occipital to frontal epileptiform discharges with age, suggesting a correlation with synaptic maturation."

This finding suggests:
- EEG evolution may serve as a biomarker for disease progression
- Epileptiform focus shifts with brain maturation
- Potential correlation with synaptic development patterns

**Clinical Implications:**
- Early diagnosis and intervention emphasized
- Critical developmental window (ages 2-5) identified for intervention
- EEG biomarkers may guide treatment timing

**Kang HC et al. 2019 - Review Article**
- **Institution:** Severance Children's Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine
- **Focus:** Gene-specific therapies for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy
- **SYNGAP1 Treatment Recommendations:**
  - Valproate and lamotrigine most commonly prescribed
  - 77% long-term retention on lamotrigine
  - 64% long-term retention on valproate
  - No targeted gene-specific therapy currently available

**Reference for Asian Population:**

> "Developmental delay preceded seizure onset in 54 of 56 (96%) patients." - [Neurology, 2019](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000006729)

**Developmental Milestones:**
- Average age at walking: **26 months** (range: 10.5 months to 5 years)
- Speech: Typically delayed or absent

| **Clobazam** | Variable | Adjunctive therapy |

**Drug-Resistant Epilepsy:**
- **63% of patients** have refractory epilepsy after 2 AEDs
- **71% of adults** have drug-resistant seizures
- Polytherapy often required

**Effective Combinations (from literature):**
- Levetiracetam + Topiramate
