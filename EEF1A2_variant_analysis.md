**Note:** EEF1A2 has an unusual mutational profile - approximately 50 different missense mutations identified but no obvious loss-of-function mutations, though large heterozygous deletions are compatible with life.

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| **Total Non-P/LP (ClinVar + Literature)** | **>614 + novel** |

### 3.2 Publications (전체논문수)
- Limited publications for VUS variants due to rarity of EEF1A2 disorders

## 5. Phenotype Review

### 5.1 Onset Age (onset)

| Phenotype | Seizure Onset | Frequency |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Early-onset severe** | 0-4 months (median ~4 months) | Most common |
| **Mild phenotype** | Late infancy | Rare |
| **BFNE-like (microdeletion)** | Neonatal | With 20q13.3 deletion |

**Typical Presentation:**
- Most children develop epileptic seizures within the first **4 months of life**
- Myoclonic seizures are the most common seizure type
- Development may be normal before seizure onset, then regresses

### 5.2 Responsive Anti-Seizure Medications (responsive ASM)

| ASM | Efficacy | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Most AEDs** | Poor/Variable | Drug-resistant epilepsy is characteristic |
| **Standard AEDs** | Variable | Some patients show mild response |
| **BFNE cases (microdeletion)** | Good | Responds well, resolves by age 4 |

**Key Treatment Findings:**
- Mutations cause **severe drug-resistant epilepsy** in most cases
- Later studies identified patients with **poor responses to drug therapies**
- Some patients with mild phenotype: epilepsy developed in late infancy and was **well-controlled with antiepileptic drugs**

**Phenotypic Variability:**
> "There is a big range in development and seizure incidence amongst people with mutations in EEF1A2. Different mutations affect the resulting protein in subtly different ways, some worse than others." - [EEF1A2 and Epilepsy Research](https://eef1a2epilepsy.com/)

### 5.3 Syndrome Diagnosis / Gene-Specific Classification

| Classification | OMIM | Key Features |
|----------------|------|--------------|
| **DEE33** (Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy, Type 33) | 616409 | Early-onset, severe, drug-resistant |
| **Intellectual Disability, Autosomal Dominant 38** | 616393 | ID with variable epilepsy |

**Clinical Features:**
- Severe global developmental delay
- Impaired intellectual development
- Poor or absent speech
- Hypotonia
- Autistic behavior (in some cases)
- Movement disorders including chorea and dystonia

**EEG Findings:**
- **Continuous high-voltage delta activity over parietal areas** - may be unique to EEF1A2

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlation:**
- Missense mutations with severe molecular alteration in **t-RNA binding sites** or **GTP hydrolysis domain** → early-onset severe epilepsy
- Location of mutation determines clinical expression
- Gain-of-function mechanism (not simple loss of function)
