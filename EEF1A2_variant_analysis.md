| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| **Total Non-P/LP (ClinVar + Literature)** | **>614 + novel** |

### 3.2 Publications (전체논문수)

---

## 4. Korean Patient Data (Korean patient)

### 4.1 Variant Count (variant수)
- **No Korean EEF1A2 patients identified** in published literature (as of January 2026)
- EEF1A2 was **not among the top genes** in the largest Korean epilepsy cohort study (Kim SH et al. 2024)
- Expected prevalence is extremely low (global estimate: <70 published cases)

### 4.2 Publications (전체논문수)

| Study | Finding for EEF1A2 |
|-------|-------------------|
| Kim SH et al. 2024 (Epilepsia) | EEF1A2 not listed among top genes in 957 Asian (99% Korean) epilepsy patients |
| Korean epilepsy registries | No published Korean EEF1A2 case reports identified |

**Large Korean Epilepsy Cohort Context (Kim SH et al. 2024):**
- 957 Asian patients with pediatric epilepsy (947 Korean)
- Overall diagnostic yield: 32.4%
- Top genes identified: SCN1A (49), STXBP1 (15), SCN2A (14), KCNQ2 (13), CDKL5 (11)
- **EEF1A2 not reported** - likely 0 cases or too few to list

### 4.3 Reported Patients (전체보고 환자수)
- **0 published Korean patients** with EEF1A2 mutations
- Cases may exist in unpublished clinical databases

### 4.4 Variant-to-Patient Frequency (variant별 환자수 빈도)
- Data not available from Korean sources

### 4.5 Asian Population Data

While no Korean-specific data exists, EEF1A2 cases have been reported from other Asian countries:

| Country | Patients | Reference |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Japan | 2+ | Nakajima et al. 2015 (p.D252H, p.E122K) |
| China | Multiple case reports | He et al. 2024, others |
| Korea | **0 published** | - |

**Japanese Cases (Nakajima et al. 2015):**
- 2 unrelated Japanese girls with autosomal dominant intellectual developmental disorder-38 (MRD38)
- De novo heterozygous mutations: p.D252H and p.E122K
- Associated with characteristic facial features, ID, autism, and epilepsy

**Possible Explanations for Lack of Korean Cases:**
1. Ultra-rare disorder (estimated 1:500,000 - 1:1,000,000)
2. Underdiagnosis - not included in all gene panels
3. Cases may exist but not published
4. True absence in Korean population (unlikely given Japanese cases)

## 5. Phenotype Review

### 5.1 Onset Age (onset)

| Phenotype | Seizure Onset | Frequency |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Early-onset severe** | 0-4 months (median ~4 months) | Most common |
| **Mild phenotype** | Late infancy | Rare |
| **BFNE-like (microdeletion)** | Neonatal | With 20q13.3 deletion |

**Typical Presentation:**
- Most children develop epileptic seizures within the first **4 months of life**
- Myoclonic seizures are the most common seizure type
- Development may be normal before seizure onset, then regresses

### 5.2 Responsive Anti-Seizure Medications (responsive ASM)

| ASM | Efficacy | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Most AEDs** | Poor/Variable | Drug-resistant epilepsy is characteristic |
| **Standard AEDs** | Variable | Some patients show mild response |
| **BFNE cases (microdeletion)** | Good | Responds well, resolves by age 4 |

**Key Treatment Findings:**
- Mutations cause **severe drug-resistant epilepsy** in most cases
- Later studies identified patients with **poor responses to drug therapies**
- Some patients with mild phenotype: epilepsy developed in late infancy and was **well-controlled with antiepileptic drugs**

**Phenotypic Variability:**
> "There is a big range in development and seizure incidence amongst people with mutations in EEF1A2. Different mutations affect the resulting protein in subtly different ways, some worse than others." - [EEF1A2 and Epilepsy Research](https://eef1a2epilepsy.com/)

### 5.3 Syndrome Diagnosis / Gene-Specific Classification

| Classification | OMIM | Key Features |
|----------------|------|--------------|
| **DEE33** (Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy, Type 33) | 616409 | Early-onset, severe, drug-resistant |
| **Intellectual Disability, Autosomal Dominant 38** | 616393 | ID with variable epilepsy |

**Clinical Features:**
- Severe global developmental delay
- Impaired intellectual development
- Poor or absent speech
- Hypotonia
- Autistic behavior (in some cases)
- Movement disorders including chorea and dystonia

**EEG Findings:**
- **Continuous high-voltage delta activity over parietal areas** - may be unique to EEF1A2

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlation:**
- Missense mutations with severe molecular alteration in **t-RNA binding sites** or **GTP hydrolysis domain** → early-onset severe epilepsy
- Location of mutation determines clinical expression
- Gain-of-function mechanism (not simple loss of function)
